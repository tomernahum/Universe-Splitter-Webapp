ANU QRNG API is limited to 1 request per minute
example: https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/jsonI.php?length=1&type=uint8 (also look at git history for whatever I really used)


we can request lots of numbers and cache them though if we want, though we don't currently do that
    good excuse to learn durable objects, or learn go or something, or redis, or even vibe coding
we can also use their paid aws api instead (but would want to do above anyway to save)


ethz seems to be down, previously could not be accessed within a browser http://qrng.ethz.ch/api/randint?min=1&max=${numUniverses}&size=${numResults}

for now I have switched to this api (credit universesplitterunofficial app, no affiliation, for listing it in their github): qrandom.io

they do not seem to have the cors header required for me to just call their api from the browser client... hold on
