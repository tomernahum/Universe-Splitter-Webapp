1)
I have deployed this on cloudflare pages
it is best to use their local server command line tool Wrangler to preview the files

cloudflare pages has a few quirks compared to other simple servers such as github pages or popular html file previewing vscode extensions,
namely it gets rid of the .html at the end of urls, and url addresses affect offline caching for this PWA


Install: `npm install -g wrangler` (u need node and npm)
Run: `wrangler pages dev <THIS-DIRECTORY>`


2)
Also the way I have it currently set up the service worker caches everything locally, 
in order to actually update stuff on the page you have to go into sw.js and change CHACHE_NAME so it updates the cache
this was the way I was tutorialized to do it, im sure theres a better way but I havn't done it
or check update on reload / bypass for network in chrome dev tools > application > service workers
