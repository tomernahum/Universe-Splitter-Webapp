Todo List:
- A lot of weird stuff on mobile i have no idea why :`(
- Semantic HTML + HTML SEO
- Animations

- More efficient api calling
- Select different Servers

- Prevent errors from asking for more than 1 split per second

- (Possibly rewrite everything (use Sass this time))


Ideas:
Footer 1: inspiration, github, contact , maybe explanation (seperate page)
Footer 2 (where else to put it?): Source, cacheUniverses checkbox with ?






To Do List:
- better position / decide position the dark mode button
- change html tags for better accessability // maybe SEO
- animate in list additions. 
Also scroll automatically to them.
Also maybe make them show up on top instead of bottom

- Color the button and button highlight
- Style the theme switching button
- Add Name and context of universe splitter app / theory (maybe)

- Make it scrollable past the end text for convienient use on mobile
- more efficient api calling

- maybe make the button truly center idk
- maybe make the darkmode toggle to right of main column not whole viewport (or may put in bottom bar with info button)

- allow selection of universe splitting source (fake, anu, any others)
- Make it responsive to smart watches
