Temp Todo List (do next):
1. Second navbar with server select & pre-split option (+ the js code for it)
    - Potentially: make it hover at bottom of screen like the button hovers at top, but keep the real navbar non-hover
2. potentially: rework output to put new stuff at top, errors somewhere else, and store history locally, (+ maybe make it not take 2 lines same method as split)
3. Basic SEO stuff like meta description
4. Make a second page with more traditional U-split (Enter in two choices and pick one), then maybe make that the main page and link to the page we got
5. Analytics
6. then advertise it somewhere

Other (potentially):
- Make sure vh is good for mobile
- Animations
- "Star me" popup when hovering on source code
- Replace Email with feedback and when you click it make a list of places to feedback (github issues, email, maybe discord or zendesk lol)
- Improve colors esp of button
- make output take 1 line on smaller devices
- Maybe: allow manual editing of universes number if you click the number
- indicator hidden somewhere of whether stuff is cached locally? (or just in the console)
- make explanation theming consistent
- cache light/dark mode preference and if its not cached then set it according to system preferences
- pick an open source license and add it to the github
- make sure accessability is good (see firefox dev tools as start)
- rename dark and light classes to darkmode and light mode.   maybe rename preferred theme to theme idk


APIs I know about (have not looked deeply at all of them):
- anu deprecated api: https://qrng.anu.edu.au/
- anu paid aws api: https://qrng.anu.edu.au/ https://quantumnumbers.anu.edu.au/
    - Maybe make backend (with _base) to cache universe splits to save on costs (would be transparent with users about this)

- ETHZ (does not seem to work but its likely i dont understand REST apis) (one that was reccomended in review of universe splitter unnoficial) http://qrng.ethz.ch/http_api/
- hu-berlin (requires download of a program? and sample data is downloaded as .bin) (need to look into it but seems like it might need a backend) https://qrng.physik.hu-berlin.de/download 

- cypto focused one found on google search: https://www.quantumblockchains.io/quantum-cryptography-qrng-qkd/qrng-api/
- Look into IBM Qiskit might be a default provider?

- Find More:
    - Google qrng (quantum random numbers) "-anu" to exclude anu
    - ! https://pypi.org/project/qrng/ -- references IBM Qiskit which has backend providers (so search for qiskit providers) https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/manage/provider/#open-provider https://github.com/ozaner/qRNG https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/
    - academic wiki it seems (weird api sources like hu-berlin) https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/quantum-random-number-generators
    - read the articles https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=qrng+alibaba+cloud
    - where is this implementation? https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quantum-generators-of-random-numbers-Jacak-J%C3%B3zwiak/135c8a6eb0d62ceefe89aca52a95f9b5055bd662
    - Not sure what this is https://github.com/openqbit-diy/MiniQRNG
    - 
    
- If anyone actually uses the app and funds it (probably wouldn't) could hypothetically buy a quantum device and set up a server of my own https://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/products/
- Can add "true" random but not quantum (eg whatever random.org has) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators#Random_number_generators_that_use_external_entropy 

- Example of someone using ibm i think https://github.com/openqbit-diy/MiniQRNG  https://github.com/AFOEK/Quantum_Random_Number_Generator_Flask/blob/main/main.py

Todo List Old:
- A lot of weird stuff on mobile i have no idea why :`(
- Semantic HTML + HTML SEO
- Animations

- More efficient api calling
- Select different Servers

- Prevent errors from asking for more than 1 split per second

- (Possibly rewrite everything (use Sass this time))


Ideas:
Footer 1: inspiration, github, contact , maybe explanation (seperate page)
Footer 2 (where else to put it?): Source, cacheUniverses checkbox with (?) hover

We Need:
- inspired By
- explanation
- source code // star me on github
- Email Feedback OR feedback which opens menu of email, github issues,
- Add to homescreen / install PWA

- API Source dropdown, 
- cacheUniverses checkbox with (?) hover

- dark mode toggle

Ideas:
inspired by, explanation, add to homescreen
source code, feedback






To Do List:
- better position / decide position the dark mode button
- change html tags for better accessability // maybe SEO
- animate in list additions. 
Also scroll automatically to them.
Also maybe make them show up on top instead of bottom

- Color the button and button highlight
- Style the theme switching button
- Add Name and context of universe splitter app / theory (maybe)

- Make it scrollable past the end text for convienient use on mobile
- more efficient api calling

- maybe make the button truly center idk
- maybe make the darkmode toggle to right of main column not whole viewport (or may put in bottom bar with info button)

- allow selection of universe splitting source (fake, anu, any others)
- Make it responsive to smart watches
