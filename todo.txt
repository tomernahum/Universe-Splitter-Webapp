Temp Todo List (do next):
1. Second navbar with server select & pre-split option (+ the js code for it)
    - Potentially: make it hover at bottom of screen like the button hovers at top, but keep the real navbar non-hover
2. potentially: rework output to put new stuff at top, errors somewhere else, and store history locally, (+ maybe make it not take 2 lines same method as split)
3. Basic SEO stuff like meta description
4. Make a second page with more traditional U-split (Enter in two choices and pick one), then maybe make that the main page and link to the page we got
5. then advertise it somewhere

Other (potentially):
- Make sure vh is good for mobile
- Animations
- "Star me" popup when hovering on source code
- Replace Email with feedback and when you click it make a list of places to feedback (github issues, email, maybe discord or zendesk lol)
- Improve colors
- make output take 1 line on smaller devices
- Maybe: allow manual editing of universes number if you click the number
- indicator hidden somewhere of whether stuff is cached locally? (or just in the console)
- make explanation theming consistent
- cache light/dark mode preference and if its not cached then set it according to system preferences
- pick an open source license and add it to the github



Todo List:
- A lot of weird stuff on mobile i have no idea why :`(
- Semantic HTML + HTML SEO
- Animations

- More efficient api calling
- Select different Servers

- Prevent errors from asking for more than 1 split per second

- (Possibly rewrite everything (use Sass this time))


Ideas:
Footer 1: inspiration, github, contact , maybe explanation (seperate page)
Footer 2 (where else to put it?): Source, cacheUniverses checkbox with (?) hover

We Need:
- inspired By
- explanation
- source code // star me on github
- Email Feedback OR feedback which opens menu of email, github issues,
- Add to homescreen / install PWA

- API Source dropdown, 
- cacheUniverses checkbox with (?) hover

- dark mode toggle

Ideas:
inspired by, explanation, add to homescreen
source code, feedback






To Do List:
- better position / decide position the dark mode button
- change html tags for better accessability // maybe SEO
- animate in list additions. 
Also scroll automatically to them.
Also maybe make them show up on top instead of bottom

- Color the button and button highlight
- Style the theme switching button
- Add Name and context of universe splitter app / theory (maybe)

- Make it scrollable past the end text for convienient use on mobile
- more efficient api calling

- maybe make the button truly center idk
- maybe make the darkmode toggle to right of main column not whole viewport (or may put in bottom bar with info button)

- allow selection of universe splitting source (fake, anu, any others)
- Make it responsive to smart watches
