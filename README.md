# Universe-Splitter-Webapp
__[universe-splitter.ttools.io](https://universe-splitter.ttools.io/)__ \
Vanilla HTML+CSS+JS Site to call an API to split the universe (according to one theory), inspired by http://cheapuniverses.com/universesplitter/ iphone app

 

Working on more features (see todo.txt) \
actually its mostly abandoned but maybe I will work on it again.  

This was my first ever webapp!
